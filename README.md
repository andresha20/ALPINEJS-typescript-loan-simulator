# ALPINEJS-typescript-loan-simulator
[WIP] Loan simulator built with Alpine.js, Vite, Typescript and the almighty Tailwind.

# DEVELOPMENT DATA:
1. Everything is handled on the front using Alpine with Typescript and Tailwind. Vite was not necessary but I was curious about the implementation of TS and Alpine while using Vite.
2. Time taken: 5 hours.
3. I had never used Alpine.js before and I just realized how good it is especially when it comes to updating the DOM and not having to deal with Vanilla Javascript for extremely simple projects.
